# Test Fixtures for the Flask Web Application

## Description
This project adds test fixtures for the Flask web application using the SQLAlchemy toolkit. It performs basic operations such as account creation, update, and delete.

## Pre-Requisites

### 1. Happy Paths
- **Happy Path**: Verifies that the function returns the expected value when a positive outcome is tested.

### 2. Sad Paths
- **Sad Path**: Ensures the function responds appropriately to exceptions without breaking when a negative outcome is tested.

### 3. Test Fixtures
- **Test Fixtures**: Establish a known initial state before and after each test. Test fixtures are useful for various testing situations, such as creating mock data objects and loading the database with a known dataset.

#### Test fixtures operate at three levels of specificity:

#### Module Level
Runs once before and after all tests in the module.

```python
def setUpModule():             # Runs once before any tests


def tearDownModule():          # Runs once after all tests
    
```

### TestCase Level
Runs once before and after the test case class.

``` python
@classmethod
def setUpClass(cls):           # Runs once before the test case class
    
@classmethod
def tearDownClass(cls):        # Runs once after the test case class

```

### Test Level
Runs before and after each individual test.

``` python

def setUp(self):               # Runs before each test


def tearDown(self):            # Runs after each test

```
